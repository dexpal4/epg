There can be 50,000 honeybees in one hive, and they can beat their wings 230 times per second. Honeybees do a &apos;waggle dance&apos; that helps other bees find plants full of nectar. Nectar is a sugar-rich liquid, and the bees use it to make their honey. Next, they meet some naked mole rats. These incredible looking creatures live underground, and the team have to use special night vision cameras to see them. The mole rats have huge teeth, no hair and spend much of their time walking backwards. These two animals are very different, but Aneeshwar and Lizzie discover what the unusual and extraordinary wild connection is between them.</desc></programme><programme start="20250520114500 +0000" stop="20250520120000 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>Teeny Tiny Creatures</title><desc>Maisie finds out all about some very busy creatures – honeybees.

The result is a coastline that is home to the world&apos;s highest concentration of sunken ships. But shipwrecks also changed the course of British history, helped shape our national character and drove innovations in seafaring technology, as well as gripping our imagination. The terrible toll taken by shipwrecks was such that in the winter of 1820 some 20,000 seaman lost their lives in the North Sea alone. That&apos;s 20 jumbo jets. But in the final part of his series, maritime historian Sam Willis tells the stirring story of how the Victorians were finally driven into action, finding various ingenious solutions - from rockets that could fire rescue lines aboard stricken vessels to life jackets, lifeboats and the Plimsoll Line, which outlawed overloading. In Africa, he traces the legend of the Birkenhead Drill - the origin of &apos;women and children first&apos;.

The result is a coastline that is home to the world&apos;s highest concentration of sunken ships. But shipwrecks also changed the course of British history, helped shape our national character and drove innovations in seafaring technology, as well as gripping our imagination. The terrible toll taken by shipwrecks was such that in the winter of 1820 some 20,000 seaman lost their lives in the North Sea alone. That&apos;s 20 jumbo jets. But in the final part of his series, maritime historian Sam Willis tells the stirring story of how the Victorians were finally driven into action, finding various ingenious solutions - from rockets that could fire rescue lines aboard stricken vessels to life jackets, lifeboats and the Plimsoll Line, which outlawed overloading.

Duran Duran came out of Birmingham and conquered the world during the 1980s. Originally a New Romantic band in full make-up and cossack pants, they rapidly became bedroom pin-ups for a generation of teenage girls. Led by Simon Le Bon, Nick Rhodes and John Taylor, Duran Duran dominated the British and American charts in the mid-1980s with classic singles such as Rio, Save a Prayer and Wild Boys. Pioneers of the MTV-style promo video - from the X-rated Girls on Film to Raiders of the Lost Ark spoof Hungry Like the Wolf - Duran Duran were the 80s equivalent of The Beatles in America and outsold Spandau Ballet and Wham! in their pomp. Sixty million records later, Le Bon and Rhodes are seen touring America with their Pop Trash project from the early 2000s. The documentary reflects on the heady heights of Duran Duran&apos;s career, the cracks in their make-up plus the effects of sex, drugs and fame on ordinary boys from working-class backgrounds.

It was an exciting, explosive super-decade, in which a dazzling array of new genres emerged while video really did kill the radio star. It was also an age of innovators and icons, of style and substance. Here, Dylan celebrates some of the stars who created the timeless legacy of the 1980s. From stellar BBC archive performances from the likes of Madonna, Depeche Mode, Sade, Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys and Tina Turner to iconic MTV-era gems from Billy Idol, Eurythmics, U2, Janet Jackson, Prince and many more. It also features rarely seen archive television footage from the BBC vaults, including Terry Wogan interviewing Grace Jones, Bruce Springsteen on the Old Grey Whistle Test and Adam Ant performing his own stunts in a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the Prince Charming video.</desc></programme><programme start="20250524010500 +0000" stop="20250524013500 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>Top of the Pops</title><desc>Jo Whiley presents the pop chart programme, first broadcast on 12 December 1997 and featuring Janet Jackson, The Seahorses, Robbie Williams, Sheryl Crow, Blackstreet, Five, All Saints and Teletubbies.</desc></programme><programme start="20250524013500 +0000" stop="20250524020500 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>Top of the Pops</title><desc>Jayne Middlemiss presents the pop chart programme, first broadcast on 19 December 1997 and featuring Natalie Imbruglia, Robbie Williams, Bryan Adams, All Saints, U2, Chicken Shed, Celine Dion, Sting &amp; The Police and Teletubbies.</desc></programme><programme start="20250524020500 +0000" stop="20250524024500 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>Top of the Pops</title><desc>Mike Read presents the pop chart programme, first broadcast on 22 May 1980 and featuring The Lambrettas, UK Subs, Michael Jackson, Jona Lewie, Karel Fialka, The Specials, Matchbox and Johnny Logan, and a dance routine from Legs &amp; Co.</desc></programme><programme start="20250524024500 +0000" stop="20250524043000 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>This is BBC Four</title><desc>Programmes start at 7.00pm.</desc></programme><programme start="20250524043000 +0000" stop="20250524060000 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>This is BBC Four</title><desc>WARNING : show ends after 06:00!!

Charli is meeting her friend Annabel for lunch at the local café. They haven’t been out for a lunch treat for ages, and the café’s speciality is Tinks’s favourite – chicken. First, Charli parks her car using her blue parking badge and then gets her wheelchair out of the boot using a hoist. Tinks then helps Charli go into the café, find a table and go to the counter to order their lunch. But when the café owner sees Tinks, he tells Charli that they only allow in guide dogs and that Tinks will have to wait outside.

Brian relates how Dundee and the east coast of Scotland, with its distinct brand of humour, was always part of Bob’s appeal and how he partly based his performance on his own brother. He also reveals how, despite the wide acclaim he’s received over the years for his unforgettable dramatic roles, he’s always considered himself to be more of a comic performer, for whom Bob Servant and his eccentric ways ended up being a perfect fit.</desc></programme><programme start="20250524201500 +0000" stop="20250524204500 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>Bob Servant</title><desc>Bob Servant launches his political campaign with controversial results.

It was an exciting, explosive super-decade, in which a dazzling array of new genres emerged while video really did kill the radio star. It was also an age of innovators and icons, of style and substance. Here, Dylan celebrates some of the stars who created the timeless legacy of the 1980s. From stellar BBC archive performances from the likes of Madonna, Depeche Mode, Sade, Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys and Tina Turner to iconic MTV-era gems from Billy Idol, Eurythmics, U2, Janet Jackson, Prince and many more. It also features rarely seen archive television footage from the BBC vaults, including Terry Wogan interviewing Grace Jones, Bruce Springsteen on the Old Grey Whistle Test and Adam Ant performing his own stunts in a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the Prince Charming video.</desc></programme><programme start="20250525010500 +0000" stop="20250525013500 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>Top of the Pops</title><desc>Jo Whiley presents the pop chart programme, first broadcast on 12 December 1997 and featuring Janet Jackson, The Seahorses, Robbie Williams, Sheryl Crow, Blackstreet, Five, All Saints and Teletubbies.</desc></programme><programme start="20250525013500 +0000" stop="20250525020500 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>Top of the Pops</title><desc>Jayne Middlemiss presents the pop chart programme, first broadcast on 19 December 1997 and featuring Natalie Imbruglia, Robbie Williams, Bryan Adams, All Saints, U2, Chicken Shed, Celine Dion, Sting &amp; The Police and Teletubbies.</desc></programme><programme start="20250525020500 +0000" stop="20250525024500 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>Top of the Pops</title><desc>Mike Read presents the pop chart programme, first broadcast on 22 May 1980 and featuring The Lambrettas, UK Subs, Michael Jackson, Jona Lewie, Karel Fialka, The Specials, Matchbox and Johnny Logan, and a dance routine from Legs &amp; Co.</desc></programme><programme start="20250525024500 +0000" stop="20250525043000 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>This is BBC Four</title><desc>Programmes start at 7.00pm.</desc></programme><programme start="20250525043000 +0000" stop="20250525060000 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>This is BBC Four</title><desc>WARNING : show ends after 06:00!!

Brian relates how Dundee and the east coast of Scotland, with its distinct brand of humour, was always part of Bob’s appeal and how he partly based his performance on his own brother. He also reveals how, despite the wide acclaim he’s received over the years for his unforgettable dramatic roles, he’s always considered himself to be more of a comic performer, for whom Bob Servant and his eccentric ways ended up being a perfect fit.</desc></programme><programme start="20250525201500 +0000" stop="20250525204500 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>Bob Servant</title><desc>Bob Servant launches his political campaign with controversial results.

Parents, carers and their babies at home are invited to join in with all the fun activities too! Inside Giovanna’s bag are colourful sheets of sandpaper, and all the parents and little ones have different objects and toys that feel rough. These are explored through discovery, play, song and story. Grown-ups at home are encouraged to take part by hiding a safe, baby-appropriate rough object or toy inside a fabric bag or pillowcase for them to reveal and explore with their baby! The nursery rhyme Michael Finnegan features, as does a story involving Baby Bear and Baby Tiger, and viewers at home show how they’ve been exploring rough things too. The Baby Bear Song gets everyone moving about, before some calm time with sensory lights and the Goodbye Song.</desc></programme><programme start="20250531093500 +0000" stop="20250531094500 +0000" channel="bbcfourcbeebies.uk"><title>My First</title><desc>During a picnic with his family, Max and his family discover an amazing lighthouse with lots of stairs.
